# Mode definitions for KA9Q software receiver - Oct 2017

# Name - name of mode
# Demod - Demodulator thread: FM or LINEAR
#    FM - frequency demodulation by complex arctangent, with suppression of weak samples for threshold extension
#    AM - amplitude demodulation by envelope detection
#    LINEAR - everything else: CW/SSB, coherent AM, DSB/BPSK, ISB (can also do envelope detection)

# Filter high and low - digital IF bandpass filter frequency limits
# Offset - frequency shift applied *after* filtering; carrier, normally at zero, will come out at specified offset; N/A to FM and envelope detection
# AGC attack - AGC attack rate, dB/s (negative); N/A to FM
# AGC recovery - AGC recovery rate, dB/s (positive); N/A to FM
# agc hang - AGC hang time before recovery, sec; N/A to FM

# flags:
#    flat - bypass de-emphasis and PL tone removal (FM only)
#    conj - cross-combine the complex conjugates of the upper and lower sidebands - for ISB (independent sideband) (linear only)
#    mono - send only I channel as mono; otherwise stereo with I on left and Q on right (linear only, others are inherently mono)
#    pll - Acquire and coherently track carrier; without "square", uses conventional PLL (linear only)
#    square - square signal before coherent tracking (for suppressed carrier DSB and BPSK) (linear only)
#    cal - special calibrate mode for WWV/CHU: adjusts TCXO offset to bring measured carrier offset to zero (implies pll) (linear only)
