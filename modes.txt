# Mode definitions for KA9Q software receiver
# The following demodulators are currently available:
# FM - frequency demodulation by complex arctangent, with suppression of weak samples for threshold extension
# AM - envelope (magnitude) detection of complex signal
# CAM - coherent AM: track carrier and use as I channel phase reference, discard Q
# IQ  - I and Q channels to left and right channels; CONJ option gives ISB (independent sideband)
# SSB - Single Sideband; I channel sent to mono output, Q channel not computed
# DSB - square I channel and perform FFT, use DC bin phase reference, send I and Q as stereo (Q should be noise)
