# Mode definitions for KA9Q software receiver
# The following demodulators are currently available:
# FM - frequency demodulation by complex arctangent, with suppression of weak samples for threshold extension
# AM - envelope (magnitude) detection of complex signal
# IQ  - I and Q channels to left and right channels; CONJ option gives ISB (independent sideband)
# SSB - Single Sideband; I channel sent to mono output, Q channel not computed
# DSB - (coherent) Double Sideband; I on left, Q on right; CAL - calibrate, DSB - squaring loop
